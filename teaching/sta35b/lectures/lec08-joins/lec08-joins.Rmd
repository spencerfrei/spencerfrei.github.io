### Joins
 
Today we'll talk about joins.  (Material/slides taken from R4DS2, Chapter 19)

It's rare that a data analysis involves only a single data frame.

Typically you have many data frames, and you must **join** them together to answer the questions that you're interested in.

**Two important types of joins:**

-   Mutating joins, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.
-   Filtering joins, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in another.

We'll begin by discussing *keys*, the variables used to connect a pair of data frames in a join.

---

### Keys

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

To understand joins, you need to first understand how two tables can be connected through a pair of keys, within each table.

### Primary and foreign keys

Every join involves a pair of keys: a primary key and a foreign key.
A **primary key** is a variable or set of variables that uniquely identifies each observation.
When more than one variable is needed, the key is called a **compound key.** 

---

### Keys

<div class="pull-left">
For example, in nycflights13:

-   `airlines` records two pieces of data about each airline: its carrier code and its full name.
    You can identify an airline with its two letter carrier code, making `carrier` the primary key.

    ```{r, output.lines=7}
    airlines
    ```

</div>
<div class="pull-right">

-   `airports` records data about each airport.
    You can identify each airport by its three letter airport code, making `faa` the primary key.

    ```{r, output.lines=7}
    #| R.options:
    #|   width: 67
    airports
    ```
    
</div>

---

### Keys

-   `planes` records data about each plane.
    You can identify a plane by its tail number, making `tailnum` the primary key.

    ```{r, output.lines=6}
    #| R.options:
    #|   width: 67
    planes
    ```

-   `weather` records data about the weather at the origin airports.
    You can identify each observation by the combination of location and time, making `origin` and `time_hour` the compound primary key.

    ```{r, output.lines=7}
    #| R.options:
    #|   width: 67
    weather
    ```
<div class="pull-left">

</div>

<div class="pull-right">


</div>

--- 

### Keys

<div class="pull-left">
A **foreign key** is a variable (or set of variables) that corresponds to a primary key in another table.
For example:

-   `flights$tailnum` is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key `planes$tailnum`.
-   `flights$carrier` is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key `airlines$carrier`.
-   `flights$origin` is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key `airports$faa`.
-   `flights$dest` is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key `airports$faa`.
-   `flights$origin`-`flights$time_hour` is a compound foreign key that corresponds to the compound primary key `weather$origin`-`weather$time_hour`.

</div>
<div class="pull-right">

```{r}
#| label: fig-flights-relationships
#| echo: false
#| out-width: '75%'
#| fig-cap: |
#|   Connections between all five data frames in the nycflights13 package.
#|   Variables making up a primary key are colored grey, and are connected
#|   to their corresponding foreign keys with arrows.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   The relationships between airports, planes, flights, weather, and
#|   airlines datasets from the nycflights13 package. airports$faa
#|   connected to the flights$origin and flights$dest. planes$tailnum
#|   is connected to the flights$tailnum. weather$time_hour and
#|   weather$origin are jointly connected to flights$time_hour and 
#|   flights$origin. airlines$carrier is connected to flights$carrier.
#|   There are no direct connections between airports, planes, airlines, 
#|   and weather data frames.

```
</div>

### Checking primary keys

<div class="pull-left">

It's good practice to verify that primary keys indeed uniquely identify each observation.
One way to do that is to `count()` the primary keys and look for entries where `n` is greater than one.
This reveals that `planes` and `weather` both look good:

```{r}
planes |> 
  count(tailnum) |> 
  filter(n > 1)

weather |> 
  count(time_hour, origin) |> 
  filter(n > 1)
```
</div>

<div class="pull-right">

You should also check for missing values in your primary keys --- if a value is missing then it can't identify an observation!

```{r}
planes |> 
  filter(is.na(tailnum))

weather |> 
  filter(is.na(time_hour) | is.na(origin))
```

</div>
---


### Exercises

1.  We forgot to draw the relationship between `weather` and `airports` in @fig-flights-relationships.
    What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?

2.  `weather` only contains information for the three origin airports in NYC.
    If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional connection would it make to `flights`?

3.  The `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin` variables almost form a compound key for `weather`, but there's one hour that has duplicate observations.
    Can you figure out what's special about that hour?

4.  We know that some days of the year are special and fewer people than usual fly on them (e.g., Christmas eve and Christmas day).
    How might you represent that data as a data frame?
    What would be the primary key?
    How would it connect to the existing data frames?

5.  Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the `Batting`, `People`, and `Salaries` data frames in the Lahman package.
    Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between `People`, `Managers`, `AwardsManagers`.
    How would you characterize the relationship between the `Batting`, `Pitching`, and `Fielding` data frames?

### Mutating joins

* A **mutating join** allows you to combine variables from two data frames: it first matches observations by their keys, then copies across variables from one data frame to the other.

* Like `mutate()`, the join functions add variables to the right, so if your dataset has many variables, you won't see the new ones.

* Let's focus on restricted flights dataset
```{r}
flights2 <- flights |> 
  select(year, time_hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2
```

---

### Mutating joins
* Four types of mutating join, but one you'll use almost all of the time: `left_join()`.
* Output will always have the same rows as `x`, the data frame you're joining to
* The primary use of `left_join()` is to add in additional metadata.
* For example, we can use `left_join()` to add the full airline name to the `flights2` data:
```{r, output.lines=6}
flights2 |>
  left_join(airlines)
```

---

### More examples of `left_join()`'s


Temperature and wind speed when each plane departed:

```{r, output.lines=7}
flights2 |> 
  left_join(weather |> select(origin, time_hour, temp, wind_speed))
```

What size of plane was flying:

```{r, output.lines=7}
flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes |> select(tailnum, type, engines, seats))
```

---

### `left_join()` when rows are missing

When `left_join()` fails to find a match for a row in `x`, it fills in the new variables with missing values.

For example, there's no information about the plane with tail number `N3ALAA` so the `type`, `engines`, and `seats` will be missing:

```{r}
flights2 |> 
  filter(tailnum == "N3ALAA") |> 
  left_join(planes |> select(tailnum, type, engines, seats))
```

We'll return to this problem later. 

---



### Specifying join keys

* By default, `left_join()` will use all variables that appear in both data frames as the join key, the so called **natural** join.
* This is a useful heuristic, but it doesn't always work.
* For example, what happens if we try to join `flights2` with the complete `planes` dataset?

```{r, output.lines=7}
flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes)
```

* We get a lot of missing matches because our join is trying to use `tailnum` and `year` as a compound key.
* Both `flights` and `planes` have a `year` column but they mean different things: `flights$year` is the year the flight occurred and `planes$year` is the year the plane was built.
* We only want to join on `tailnum` so we need to provide an explicit specification with `join_by()`:

---

### Specifying join keys
* We can specify the join keys using `join_by()`:

```{r, output.lines=7}
flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes, join_by(tailnum))
```

Note that the `year` variables are disambiguated in the output with a suffix (`year.x` and `year.y`), which tells you whether the variable came from the `x` or `y` argument.
You can override the default suffixes with the `suffix` argument.


---

### Specifying join keys
*  `join_by(tailnum)` is short for `join_by(tailnum == tailnum)`.
```{r, output.lines=7}
flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes, join_by(tailnum == tailnum))
```

* More generally:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
original_df %>%
  left_join(new_df, join_by(df1_variable == df2_variable))
```

* For example: we can join the `flight2` and `airports` table either by `dest` or `origin`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights2 |> 
  left_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa)) # adds columns for dest carrier name

flights2 |> 
  left_join(airports, join_by(origin == faa)) # adds columns for origin carrier name
```

---

### Filtering joins

* Primary action of a **filtering join** is to filter the rows.
* Two types: semi-joins and anti-joins.
* **Semi-joins** keep all rows in `x` that have a match in `y`.
* For example, semi-join to filter the `airports` dataset to show just the origin airports:

```{r}
airports |> 
  semi_join(flights2, join_by(faa == origin))
```

---

### Anti-joins
* Anti-joins return all rows in `x` that don't have a match in `y`.
* Useful for finding missing values that are **implicit** in the data
  - Implicitly missing values don't show up as `NA`s but instead only exist as an absence.

* For example, we can find rows that are missing from `airports` by looking for flights that don't have a matching destination airport:

```{r, output.lines=7}
flights2 |> 
  anti_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa)) |> 
  distinct(dest)
```
