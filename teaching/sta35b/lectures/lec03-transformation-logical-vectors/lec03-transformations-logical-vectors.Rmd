Main data types we use in R:
* Logical/boolean (`TRUE`, `FALSE`)
* Numeric (13.8)
* Character/string ("hello")
* Missing (`NA`)

For logical vectors, every element takes one of 3 values: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NA`

We'll investigate how to manipulate and transform data to get logicals, and how to use logicals.

### Logical comparators

.pull-left[
Three basic logical operators that we will use over and over:
* AND (denoted `&` in R): operation between two logicals
* OR (denoted `|` in R): operation between two logicals
* NOT (denoted `!` in R): operation on a single logical.

Truth table for AND:

| A     | B     | `A AND B` |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TRUE`  | `TRUE`  | `TRUE`    |
| `TRUE`  | `FALSE` | `FALSE`   |
| `FALSE` | `TRUE`  | `FALSE`   |
| `FALSE` | `FALSE` | `FALSE`   |

]

.pull-right[

Truth table for OR:

| A     | B     | A OR B |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TRUE`  | `TRUE`  | `TRUE`    |
| `TRUE`  | `FALSE` | `TRUE`   |
| `FALSE` | `TRUE`  | `TRUE`   |
| `FALSE` | `FALSE` | `FALSE`   |

Truth table for NOT:

| A     | NOT A |
|-------|-------|
| `TRUE`  | `FALSE` |
| `FALSE` | `TRUE`  |

]

### Comparisons
Common way to create a logical vector: numeric comparison with `<`, `!=`, etc.

We have implicitly been using this when doing filtering.

```{r, output.lines=2}
flights$dep_time > 600
```

Using a comparator between two vectors of logicals returns pairwise comparisons.

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
y <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
(x & y) # x AND y
(x | y) # x OR y
```

---

### Comparisons
So when we use multiple comparisons in `filter()`, we are building a new vector of logicals.

We only keep those rows where the vector is `TRUE`.
```{r, output.lines=6}
flights %>%
  filter(dep_time > 600 & dep_time < 2000 & abs(arr_delay) < 20)
```


---

## Comparisons
Filter and mutate can be used in conjunction
```{r, output.lines=6}
flights %>%
  mutate(
    daytime = dep_time > 600 & dep_time < 2000,
    approx_ontime = abs(arr_delay) < 20,
  ) %>%
  filter(daytime & approx_ontime)
```


---

## Floating point comparisons
.pull-left[
Using `==` with floating points can cause problems.
This is because numbers are represented with finite "precision", i.e. only up to 2^{-32} or 2^{-64}.

```{r}
x <- c( (1/49) * 49, sqrt(2)^2)
x == c(1,2)
```

What's going on?  Let's look at more precise representation in R using `print(x, digits=)`:

```{r}
print(x, digits=10)
```

```{r}
print(x, digits=20)
```
]

--
.pull-right[
`dplyr::near()` helps with this, ignores small differences
```{r}
near(x, c(1,2))
```
]

---

## Missing values
.pull-left[ 
Almost any operation involving an `NA` returns `NA`.
```{r}
(NA > 5)
(10 == NA)
```

]

.pull-right[
What about `NA==NA`?
```{r}
NA==NA
```
Why?  Think of this example

```{r}
# Suppose we don't know Spencer's age
age_spencer <- NA

# And we also don't know Zelda's age
age_zelda <- NA

# Then we shouldn't know whether Spencer and
# Zelda are the same age
age_spencer == age_zelda
```

]

---

### Missing values
A useful function for dealing with `NA`: `is.na()`

`is.na(x)` works with any type of vector and returns TRUE for missing values and FALSE for everything else:

```{r}
( is.na(c(TRUE, NA, FALSE)) )
( is.na(c(1, NA, 3)) )
( is.na(c("a", NA, "b")) ) 
```


---
### Missing values
Since `is.na()` returns logicals, can be used in `filter()`:

```{r, output.lines=5}
flights %>%
  filter(is.na(dep_time))
```

Can be used to help identify where `NA` come from. e.g., why are there air_time `NA`s?

```{r, output.lines=5}
flights %>%
  select(time_hour, flight, dep_time, arr_time, air_time) %>%
  filter(is.na(air_time) & !is.na(arr_time) & !is.na(dep_time)) 
```

---

### Missing values
Let's examine how `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, and `sched_dep_time` are related.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  mutate(missing_dep_time = is.na(dep_time),
         missing_dep_delay = is.na(dep_delay),
         missing_sched_dep_time = is.na(sched_dep_time)) %>% 
  count(missing_dep_time, missing_dep_delay, missing_sched_dep_time)
```

* The only instances where `dep_delay` is missing have `dep_time` missing.

---

### Missing values 

* Is it the case that `dep_delay` = `dep_time` - `sched_dep_time`?

```{r}
flights %>% 
  mutate(dep_delay_manual = dep_time - sched_dep_time,
         manual_matches_given = near(dep_delay_manual, dep_delay)) %>%
  count(manual_matches_given)
```

Quite weird, since we are getting a lot right but also getting a lot wrong.

---

### Missing values

Let's inspect further.  What do those observations where manual doesn't match given look like? 
```{r,output.lines=8}
flights %>% 
  mutate(manual_delay = dep_time - sched_dep_time,
         manual_matches_given = near(manual_delay, dep_delay)) %>%
  filter(!manual_matches_given) %>%
  select(time_hour, flight, dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay, manual_delay)
```

The problem comes from the fact that `R` is treating `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` as integers, not time!  

Our calculation doesn't account for the fact that 5:54 is only 6 minutes away from 6:00, rather than 46.

We will later see how to properly treat dates and times.

### Boolean algebra 

.pull-left[

* Recall the basic Boolean algebra comparators, AND and OR
* There is a third one, XOR, which we won't use that often
* Can combine AND/OR with NOT and cover any combination of a pair of Booleans
]

.pull-right[

]

---

### Boolean algebra and missing values
* Booleans and missing values interact in logical, but possibly counterintuitive ways.
```{r}

df <- tibble(x = c(TRUE, FALSE, NA))

df %>% 
  mutate(
    and_NA = x & NA,
    or_NA = x | NA
  )
```

* NA OR TRUE returns true, since it is TRUE regardless of NA being FALSE or TRUE.
* NA AND TRUE returns NA since it depends on value of NA.
* NA OR FALSE returns NA since it depends on value of NA.
* NA AND FALSE returns FALSE since NA value doesn't affect result, always false.

---

### Order of operations

.pull-left[ 
Consider finding all flights departing between November and December in the tibble.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
flights %>%
  filter(month == 11 | month == 12)
```
This results in the correct calculation.

However, the following calculation does not: 
]

.pull-right[
```{r,output.lines=7}
flights %>%
  filter(month == 11 | 12)
```
Why?
* R first evaluates `month==11`, creates a logical vector `vec`.
* R then compares `vec | 12`
* When comparing a number to any logical, every nonzero number is considered TRUE.
* So `vec | 12` returns a vector with TRUE for every element
