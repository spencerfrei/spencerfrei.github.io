### Aesthetic mappings
* Let's consider the `mpg` dataframe - bundled with ggplot2.
```{r}
mpg
```
* `displ`: numerical, car's engine size, in liters
* `hwy`: numerical, car's fuel efficiency in mpg
* `class`: string / categorical, kind of car 


---

### Aesthetic mappings
* Let's look at the relationship between `displ` and `hwy` for different classes of ars
* We'll use scatterplot with numerical valu mapped to `x` and `y`, categorical to `shape` and `color`:

.pull-left[

```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) +
  geom_point()
#> Warning: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more
#> than 6 becomes difficult to discriminate
#> â„¹ you have requested 7 values. Consider specifying shapes manually if you
#>   need that many have them.
#> Warning: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

]


---

### Aesthetic mappings
* Can also use `size` and `alpha` for categorical mappings like class.
  * However, not recommended, since `size` and `alpha` are **ordered** aesthetics, and no natural ordering to these categorical variables 

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Two scatterplots next to each other, both visualizing highway fuel 
#|   efficiency versus engine size of cars and showing a negative 
#|   association. In the plot on the left class is mapped to the size 
#|   aesthetic, resulting in different sizes for each class. 
#|   In the plot on the right class is mapped the alpha aesthetic, 
#|   resulting in different alpha (transparency) levels for each class. 
#|   Each plot comes with a legend that shows the mapping between size 
#|   or alpha level and levels of the class variable.

# Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) +
  geom_point()

# Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

### Aesthetics

.pull-left[ 
* You can also set visual properties of geoms by manually supplying argments of the geom function *outide * of `aes()`, e.g. making all points in a plot blue:
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue")
```
]

.pull-left[
-   The name of a color as a character string, e.g., `color = "blue"`
-   The size of a point in mm, e.g., `size = 1`
-   The shape of a point as a number, e.g.
```{r}
#| label: fig-shapes
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig.asp: 0.364
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-cap: |
#|   R has 25 built-in shapes that are identified by numbers. There are some 
#|   seeming duplicates: for example, 0, 15, and 22 are all squares. The 
#|   difference comes from the interaction of the `color` and `fill` 
#|   aesthetics. The hollow shapes (0--14) have a border determined by `color`; 
#|   the solid shapes (15--20) are filled with `color`; the filled shapes 
#|   (21--24) have a border of `color` and are filled with `fill`.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Mapping between shapes and the numbers that represent them: 0 - square, 
#|   1 - circle, 2 - triangle point up, 3 - plus, 4 - cross, 5 - diamond, 
#|   6 - triangle point down, 7 - square cross, 8 - star, 9 - diamond plus, 
#|   10 - circle plus, 11 - triangles up and down, 12 - square plus, 
#|   13 - circle cross, 14 - square and triangle down, 15 - filled square, 
#|   16 - filled circle, 17 - filled triangle point-up, 18 - filled diamond, 
#|   19 - solid circle, 20 - bullet (smaller circle), 21 - filled circle blue, 
#|   22 - filled square blue, 23 - filled diamond blue, 24 - filled triangle 
#|   point-up blue, 25 - filled triangle point down blue.

shapes <- tibble(
  shape = c(0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6:19, 22, 21, 24, 23, 20),
  x = (0:24 %/% 5) / 2,
  y = (-(0:24 %% 5)) / 4
)
ggplot(shapes, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label = shape), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.15) +

### Geometric objects
How are these two plots similar?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 3
#| fig-alt: |
#|   There are two plots. The plot on the left is a scatterplot of highway 
#|   fuel efficiency versus engine size of cars and the plot on the right 
#|   shows a smooth curve that follows the trajectory of the relationship 
#|   between these variables. A confidence interval around the smooth 
#|   curve is also displayed.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

* Both plots contain the same x variable, the same y variable, and both describe the same data.
* Each plot uses a different geometric object, geom, to represent the data.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

# Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth()
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'
```


---

* Every geom object takes a `mapping` argument
  * Either dfeined locally in the geom arg, or inhereted from the `ggplot()` layer via `aes()`
* Obvious restrictions - can set shape of points but not lines; can set linetypes for lines but not points

```{r}
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-alt: |

# Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth()

# Center
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth()

# Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv))
```


---
* Can utilize multiple geom's together to make relationship clearer

```{r}
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-alt: |

# Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv))

# Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

---
### Displaying multiple rows of data
* Many geom's (like `geom_smooth`) use a single geometric object to display multiple rows of data
* You can set `group` aesthetic  to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects, so ggplot will then automatically group data to make multiple plots
* If you map any aesthetic to a discrete variable, it will automatically group them

.pull-left[

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-width: 3
#| fig-asp: 1
#| message: false
#| eval: false
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Three plots, each with highway fuel efficiency on the y-axis and engine 
#|   size of cars, where data are represented by a smooth curve. The first plot 
#|   only has these two variables, the center plot has three separate smooth 
#|   curves for each level of drive train, and the right plot not only has the 
#|   same three separate smooth curves for each level of drive train but these 
#|   curves are plotted in different colors, with a legend explaining which 
#|   color maps to which level. Confidence intervals around the smooth curves 
#|   are also displayed.

# Top Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth() + geom_point(alpha=0.2) 

# Top Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv))

# Bottom
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-width: 3
#| fig-asp: 1
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Three plots, each with highway fuel efficiency on the y-axis and engine 
#|   size of cars, where data are represented by a smooth curve. The first plot 
#|   only has these two variables, the center plot has three separate smooth 
#|   curves for each level of drive train, and the right plot not only has the 
#|   same three separate smooth curves for each level of drive train but these 
#|   curves are plotted in different colors, with a legend explaining which 
#|   color maps to which level. Confidence intervals around the smooth curves 
#|   are also displayed.

# Top Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth() + geom_point(alpha=0.2) 

# Top Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv))

# Bottom
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)
```

]

---

### Different mappings for different layers
* By placing mappings inside geom functions, you can use local mappings for different layers
* e.g., let's color dots according to class of car but then have a uniform line color for a `geom_smooth`:
```{r}
#| fig-width: 6

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```


---

### Different mappings for different layers
* You can also combine filtering and use multiple geom's to emphasize different things in the visualization

.pull-left[
```{r}
#| message: false

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(
    data = mpg |> filter(class == "2seater"), 
    shape = "circle open", size = 3, color = "red")
```



]

.pull-right[

```{r}
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 4

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(
    data = mpg |> filter(class == "2seater"), 
    shape = "circle open", size = 3, color = "red") +
  geom_point(
    data = mpg |> filter(class == "2seater"), 
    color = "red")
```

]

---

### Example

* Let's look through how we can create these 4 figures:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 3.25
# Left 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
# Center Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
# Center Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
# Right 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 4.5
# Left 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
# Center Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```


]

.pull-right[
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| message: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 4.5
# Center Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
# Right 
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
]

---

### Facets
.pull-left[ 
* Facetting with `facet_wrap()` splits plots into subplots based on categorical variables:
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~cyl)
```

]

.pull-right[

* To facet with the combo of 2 variables, use `facet_grid()`.
* The first argument of `facet_grid()` is also a formula, but now it's a double sided formula: `rows ~ cols`.

```{r}
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Scatterplot of highway fuel efficiency versus engine size of cars, faceted 
#|   by number of cylinders across rows and by type of drive train across 
#|   columns. This results in a 4x3 grid of 12 facets. Some of these facets have 
#|   no observations: 5 cylinders and 4 wheel drive, 4 or 5 cylinders and front 
#|   wheel drive.
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```
]

---

### Facets
* Facets share same scale for x/y axes by default
* Useful for comparing across facets, but can be limiting
* `scales` argument allows for freeing up the x or y variables

```{r}
#| fig-alt: |
#| layout-ncol: 2
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales = "free_y")
```


---

### Facets
* Which of the following makes it easier to compare engine size (`displ`) across cras with different drive trains?  
```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(. ~ drv)
```

---

### Facets
* What are advantages and disadvantages to using facets instead of color?
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) 
```


---

### Statistical transformations
.pull-left[ 
* Consider the `diamonds` dataset, in tidyverse:
```{r}
head(diamonds)
```

* Let's create a bar chart across cuts:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
* `count` is not a variable in diamonds, so how is it creating this?
]


---

### Statistical transformations


-   Bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

-   Smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.

-   Boxplots compute the five-number summary of the distribution and then display that summary as a specially formatted box.

The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a **stat**, short for statistical transformation.

```{r}
#| label: fig-vis-stat-bar
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"

knitr::include_graphics("visualization-stat-bar.png")
```



---

### Position adjustments

.pull-left[ 
* You can color bar charts using `color` or `fill` aesthetics:
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 2.5
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Two bar charts of drive types of cars. In the first plot, the bars have 
#|   colored borders. In the second plot, they're filled with colors. Heights 
#|   of the bars correspond to the number of cars in each cut category.

# Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, color = drv)) + 
  geom_bar()

# Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
]

.pull-right[
* You can also fill aesthetics with other variables
```{r}
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Segmented bar chart of drive types of cars, where each bar is filled with 
#|   colors for the classes of cars. Heights of the bars correspond to the 
#|   number of cars in each drive category, and heights of the colored 
#|   segments are proportional to the number of cars with a given class 
#|   level within a given drive type level.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
* Each rectangle represents a combo of `drv` and `class`
]


---

### Position adjustments
* The way bar charts are stacked is determined using `position` argument (position adjustment)
* For non-stacked charts, you can use three options: `position = 'identity'`, `position = 'dodge'`, `position = 'fill'`
* `position = 'identity'` is not super useful for bar charts: it places each bar exactly where it falls in context of the graph (i.e. at `drv`)
```{r}
#| fig-width: 3.5
# Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) + 
  geom_bar(alpha = 1/5, position = "identity")

# Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, color = class)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = NA, position = "identity")
```
* `position = 'identity'` is useful for geom_point, since we want all dots to appear where data is


---

### Position adjustments
* `position = "fill"` works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height. This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.

* `position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly beside one another. This makes it easier to compare individual values.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 4.5
# Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

# Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```


---

### Exploratory data analysis
Cycle through the following:

* Generate questions about your data.

* Search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modelling your data.

* Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions

Requires creativity and critical thinking.  Two questions which capture many different types of questions:
* What type of variation occurs **within** each variable?  (Mean, standard deviation, skewness, ...)
* What type of covariation occurs **between** variables?  (How does height vary with weight, ... )

---

### Variation
* **Variation** is tendency for values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement
* Can be due to measurement error (e.g., measuring height with different rulers) or due to within-group variation (different people have different heights)
* Let's explore the distribution of weights (`carat`) of the ~50k diamonds from `diamonds` dataset.
* `carat` is numerical, can use histogram:
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```

---

### Typical values
.pull-left[ 
* In bar charts and histograms, tall bars = common values; no bars = values not seen
* Questions to ask yourself:
    - Which values are the most common? Why?
    - Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?
    - Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?
* Let's look at distribution of weights of smaller diamonds.
```{r}
#| eval: false
smaller <- diamonds |> 
  filter(carat < 3)

ggplot(smaller, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
#| echo: false
smaller <- diamonds |> 
  filter(carat < 3)

ggplot(smaller, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```
* Why are there more diamonds at whole carats than fractional?
* Why are more diamonds slightly to the right of each peak than slightly to left?


]

---
### Unusual values
* If you encounter unusual values in dataset, and want to ignore them for rest of analysis, two options:
  - Drop entire row with the strange values, e.g.
```{r}
diamonds_filtered <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(between( y, 3, 20))
```
  - Replacing unusual values with missing values
```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds |> 
  mutate(y = if_else(y < 3 | y > 20, NA, y))
```

* Latter is more recommended behavior.

---
### Covariation
* **Covariation** is tendency for values of >= 2 variables to vary together in a related way

#### Categorical and numerical variable
* We can use `geom_freqpoly()` (similar to `geom_hist`) to show "frequency polygons", e.g. for how price of a diamond varies with quality
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = cut), binwidth = 500, linewidth = 0.75)
```
* Not super informative, since the height mainly reflects the count.

---

### Covariation
* More useful to understand the *density* of the variable (count / total number)
* To do this, we can use `after_stat(density)`, which does this normalization
* Default behavior is `after_stat(count)`

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-width: 4
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = cut), binwidth = 500, linewidth = 0.75)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = after_stat(count))) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = cut), binwidth = 500, linewidth = 0.75)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = after_stat(density))) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = cut), binwidth = 500, linewidth = 0.75)

```
* Doesn't appear that diamond quality has significant effect? 


---

### Covariation
* Let's further inspect with a box plot
.pull-left[ 
```{r}
#| fig-alt: 
#| fig-width: 4

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

]
.pull-right[
* Can now easily compare medians and 25th/75th percentiles
* Seems that better quality diamonds are typically cheaper!  We'll investigate further why.
]


---

### Factor orders
.pull-left[
* `cut` in the `diamonds` dataset is an **(ordered) factor**: categorical varibale which has ordering (fair < good < very good, etc)
* We'll see a lot more about factors in the next few lectures
* We can re-define the ordering of factors using `fct_reorder()`
```{r}
#| fig-alt: 
#| fig-width: 4.5

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = fct_reorder(class, hwy, median), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

]
.pull-right[
* If we have long variable names, sometimes better by making the y axis have labels 
```{r}
#| fig-alt: |
#| fig-width: 4.5
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = fct_reorder(class, hwy, median))) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
]

---

### Further inspecting diamond prices
* Recall that it appeared that diamond prices seemed inversely correlated with quality
```{r}
#| fig-alt: 
#| fig-width: 4

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
* What might be responsible for this? Recall variables: x,y,z refer to length/width/depth of diamond in mm
```{r}
colnames(diamonds)
```

* Let's look at **size** vs price.


---

### Size vs. price in diamonds
* We can try doing 3 side-by-side plots by just doing 3 ggplots:
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-width: 3.5
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = x, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = y, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = z, y = price)) +

* Some things we notice:
  * Clearly some outliers - "zero" length / width / depth diamonds apparently?
  * But still some positive correlation between x, y, z and price
* Let's clean up the tibble so we are only looking at the middle 95% of values for x, y, z

### Size vs. price in diamonds
* Let's clean up the tibble so we are only looking at the middle 95% of values for x, y, z
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-width: 4
diamonds_middle <- diamonds %>%
  filter(between(x, quantile(diamonds$x, 0.025), quantile(diamonds$x, 0.975)),
         between(y, quantile(diamonds$y, 0.025), quantile(diamonds$y, 0.975)),
         between(z, quantile(diamonds$z, 0.025), quantile(diamonds$z, 0.975)))
ggplot(diamonds_middle, aes(x = x, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds_middle, aes(x = y, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(diamonds_middle, aes(x = z, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Size vs. price in diamonds
* Appears x, y, z (length/width/depth) are highly correlated with price
* Recall that volume of a cube is length * width * depth - so let's look at the relationship between estimated volume (x\*y\*z) and price
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| fig-width: 5
diamonds_middle %>%
  mutate(est_volume = x*y*z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = est_volume, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```
* Does appear to be a strong correlation.
* Now let's think again as to why it was that we previously found that higher quality diamonds were cheaper.

---
### Size vs. price in diamonds
* Hypothesis: higher quality diamonds are smaller, lower quality diamonds are larger.
* To investigate, we could use boxplot: we want to visualize variation in size for each category of quality
.pull-left[ 
```{r}
diamonds_middle %>%
  mutate(est_volume = x*y*z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cut, y = est_volume)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

]

### Size vs price in diamonds
* Let's try to visualize the different cuts on the dot plot:
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 5
diamonds_middle %>%
  mutate(est_volume = x*y*z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = est_volume, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point()
diamonds_middle %>%
  mutate(est_volume = x*y*z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = est_volume, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

### Size vs. price in diamonds
.pull-left[ 
* We were looking at the estimated volume, but could also look at the *weight*: carat.  
* Let's see how if weight varies by class.

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| fig-width: 4
diamonds_middle %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cut, y = carat)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


]

.pull-right[
* And now let's visualize relationship between carat size and price by cut:
```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-width: 4
diamonds_middle %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point()
diamonds_middle %>%
  mutate(est_volume = x*y*z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_smooth()
```
